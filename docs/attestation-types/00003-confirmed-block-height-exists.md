# 00003 - Confirmed Block Height Exists

[Definition file](../../lib/verification/attestation-types/t-00003-confirmed-block-height-exists.ts)

## Description

Any transaction can be seen as balance decreasing if funds could have left the source address (e.g. due to fees). So even if no funds are sent out, or even the balance is increased, but the address was used as an input, this is considered as a source using the transaction. This type of transaction is illegal for an Agentâ€™s address unless it is part of some legal flow.
